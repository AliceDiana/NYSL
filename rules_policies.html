                    Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior

                <li> <strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                        within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                </li>

                <li> <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum 
                    of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state 
                    competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum 
                    requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields 
                    Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver 
                    of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or 
                    associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play
                    all their games away.</li>

                                        line. In the event that field conditions require team benches to be on the same side of 
                                        the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two (2) yards away from the

                                    than twenty yards from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose the location 
                                    of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must remain within their team's bench area 
                                    during the game.

                                    <li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite the team bench areas. Supporters of a 
                                    team must assemble on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that team. There shall 
                                    be a buffer zone extending ten yards on each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by parents or 
                                    spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate 
                                    games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or spectator declines to abide by requests from match
